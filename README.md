### Abstract:

Autoscaling in Cloud Computing is the activity of expanding or diminishing the cloud computational resources like storage, compute, and network services to meet the workload demands. When designed and overseen appropriately, the essential advantage of autoscaling is that the workload (user-requests) gets precisely the cloud computational resources it requires at any random time. A study of auto-scaling architectures, existing techniques, and open issues provides a comprehensive understanding to identify future research solutions. Several methods were proposed for mathematical modeling of the non- _stationary process of receiving user requests, allowing, as a result, forming an analytical model of the workload. The practical significance of the work lies in the possibility of using the developed methods as part of the autoscaling modules of cloud systems, ensuring more efficient management of their infrastructure resources.
